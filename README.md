### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year Electronics and Instrumentation undergrad at BITS Goa. I've been coding for a long time and nothing brings me more joy than writing a piece of code that works flawlessly.

I'm a student developer and my fields of interest are Machine Learning and Artficial Intelligence.

If I'm not doing a project then I love to listen to music, play video games and read books. I know how to play the drums and happen to be very good at it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Natural Language Processing
